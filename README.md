# FileBackup
A simple Artist friendly method of assisting a user backup files from specified directory.

C# Based - with SQL to hold information. I chose to not hold the actual backed up files within the database as I felt the group I was gearing this towards would prefer to have it on some physical drive somewhere. The Database holds information about the backup of the files, and groups them into one main object with many backup locations.

WORK IN PROGRESS!
